/*Create Exception class called BookQuantityNotAvailableException and use it in the
class called “Store” which is described by its bookId title, author, price and
quantityAvailable. Include a method called purchase() taking the purchase quantity as
a parameter and update the quantityAvailable appropriately. Create a package
containing the Store and a Exception class. Write a java program to test the working
of the Store class.*/
