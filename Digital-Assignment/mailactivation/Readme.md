* Steps:
  1. **Get the session object:** The `javax.mail.Session` class provides two methods to get the object of session, `Session.getDefaultInstance()` method and `Session.getInstance()` method. 
  2. **Compose the message:** The `javax.mail.Message` class provides methods to compose the message. But it is an abstract class so its subclass `javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage` class is mostly used. To create the message, you need to pass session object in `MimeMessage` class constructor.
