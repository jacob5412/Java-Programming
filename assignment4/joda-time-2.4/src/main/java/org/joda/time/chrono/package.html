<p>
Package containing the chronology classes which define the calendar systems.
</p>
<p>
This package contains all of the chronology implementations within the library.
A chronology represents all the rules of a calendar system.
Applications will create chronologies using the static factory methods on
each specific Chronology class - getInstance.
The currently provided chronology implementations are:
<ul>
  <li>ISO</li>
  <li>GJ (GregorianJulian)</li>
  <li>Gregorian</li>
  <li>Julian</li>
  <li>Buddhist</li>
  <li>Coptic</li>
  <li>Ethiopic</li>
  <li>Islamic</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The package also contains all of the specialised field implementations.
These classes are package scoped, along with various other chronology helper classes.
The package scoped classes (which are not shown in the javadoc) do not form part
of the public API of Joda-Time and may change at any time.
