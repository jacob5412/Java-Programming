<p>
Joda-Time is a library designed as a complete alternative to the JDK date
and time classes. It includes date, duration, time period and interval classes
and has a pluggable API for various calendar systems.
</p>
<p>
The library consists of quite a large number of classes, however most are
internal to the implementation. All the key interfaces and classes are in the main
package while the format package will be of interest for formatting.
</p>
<p>
Joda-Time is standalone and has no dependencies other than JDK 1.5.
(The jar file may work on older JDK versions, but it is untested.)
It is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0.
